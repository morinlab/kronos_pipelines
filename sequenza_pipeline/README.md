# Sequenza Pipeline

## Notes

1. A GC content file is needed for every reference genome that exists. By default, we're using 50-base windows. As you generate these, please include them in the Annotation/GC_Content of your reference build in `igenomes`. Include the window size in the file name, _e.g._ `GRCh37-lite.gc50Base.txt.gz`.
