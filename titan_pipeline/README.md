# TITAN Pipeline

## Running this Pipeline

1. Select the `setup.tsv` file that matches the human genome build used in the input BAM files. 
2. You will need to update the mutationseq_intervals and titan_intervals variables in the setup.tsv file to point to the appropriate locations. These are included in the repository.
