# TITAN Pipeline

## Notes

1. Select the `setup.tsv` file that matches the human genome build used in the input BAM files. 

2. You might have to update the `mutationseq_intervals` and `titan_intervals` variables in the setup.tsv file to point to the appropriate locations. These are included in the repository.
